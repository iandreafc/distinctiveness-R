# Distinctiveness Centrality - R
An R library to calculate Distinctiveness Centrality in social networks. 
For the [Python version please see here](https://github.com/iandreafc/distinctiveness).

Distinctiveness Centrality is a set of network metrics that attribute larger importance to distinctive connections. This provides an alternative view to that of some established metrics, which identify central nodes based on their brokerage power, the number and weight of their connections, and their ability to quickly reach all other nodes.

Formulas and full descriptions are provided in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233276).

```

## Quick Start and Tutorials
